## ReMusic 2.0

ReMusic 2.0 is the next evolution of the ReMusic project, designed to scan physical sheet music and convert it into an editable digital format. This version introduces significant improvements in both performance and user experience:

* **Rust Backend:** Harnessing the power of Rust for blazing-fast processing and enhanced scalability.
* **React Frontend:** A modern, interactive, and maintainable user interface for seamless navigation and real-time interaction.
* **Containerized Deployment:** Built to run in Docker containers, making deployment straightforward and environment-agnostic.

### Why ReMusic 2.0?

1. **Speed and Performance**
   Rust's low-level memory management and zero-cost abstractions provide exceptional speed and reliability. This allows for faster processing of scanned music sheets and smoother data handling.

2. **Interactive Frontend**
   The shift to React means a richer, more engaging user experience with responsive design and intuitive interactions. Users can view, edit, and play music sheets more fluidly than ever.

3. **Scalability and Maintainability**
   With its component-based structure, the frontend is easier to maintain and extend. Meanwhile, the Rust backend is ready for high concurrency, handling more users and larger data with ease.

4. **Effortless Deployment**
   Containerization via Docker ensures ReMusic 2.0 is easy to deploy across different environments, reducing setup complexities and improving consistency.

### Installation Instructions

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up ReMusic 2.0:
